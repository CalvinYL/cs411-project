# cs411-project

This is the readme for our 411 project. Our software is in its inception, but will soon become the core of a billion dollar business.
Did you know that 87 million knowledge workers in the US alone spend 5 hours scheduling meetings?

Tempus intends to fix that.

See ya in a billion.

Edit: We have re organized this repo so that each assignment is in its own folder. Some of the files had to be reuploaded to do this.
The folder called Tempus is the final code for the project.
However an easier way to access the project is to go to the following link:
